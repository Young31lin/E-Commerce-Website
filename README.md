# E-Commerce-Website
I built a full-stack e-commerce website with React, Django, and PostgreSQL that includes ten separate features that allows users to browse and purchase products with ease. This includes a full-featured shopping cart that allows buyers to review their products before their purchase. They would also be able to submit reviews/ratings of the products, which is displayed in the product page. Additionally, I also created a search bar that would allow users to search for products. To help navigate the website, I also implemented product pagination and product carousels that would help sort the products by ratings. I also granted administrators the power to manage products, users, and orders.

For this project, I used React and React Bootstrap to build out the frontend. When I was building out the backend, I noticed the amount of repetitive code that I was writing. As a result, I ended up using Django because of its scalability, and also how clean it makes the code. I used PostgreSQL as the database to store user, product, review, order, order item, and shipping address information. Additionally, I also used the PayPal API to build out the checkout process.
